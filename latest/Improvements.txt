"/api/data/tab1_a" new data returning structure "dict(result, error_message, data=[{},{}])" instead of "[{},{}]"

comments resource authentication!!!

limit "session_id, username, password" to use only POST, better make it redirect without password field to hide it from URL

Set it to always connected and reconnect on execute if site idle for 10 minutes

Save "Show only data nodes" state in session to persist on reloads
